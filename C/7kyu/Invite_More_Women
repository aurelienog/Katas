## Description

Task
King Arthur and his knights are having a New Years party. Last year Lancelot was jealous of Arthur, because Arthur had a date and Lancelot did not, and they started a duel.

To prevent this from happening again, Arthur wants to make sure that there are at least as many women as men at this year's party. He gave you a list of integers of all the party goers.

Arthur needs you to return true if he needs to invite more women or false if he is all set.

Input/Output
[input] integer array L ($a in PHP)
An array (guaranteed non-associative in PHP) representing the genders of the attendees, where -1 represents women and 1 represents men.

2 <= L.length <= 50

[output] a boolean value

true if Arthur need to invite more women, false otherwise.

### My solution (without using for as challenge)

#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool invite_more_women(const int array[/* count */], size_t count)
{
  int women = 0, men = 0;
  size_t i = 0;
  
  while(i < count){
    if(array[i] == 1 ){
      men++;
    } else {
      women++;
    }
    i++;
  }
  if(men <= women) {
    return false;
  } else {
    return true; 
  }
}


###  Better solution :

#include <stddef.h>

int invite_more_women(int *arr, size_t count)
{
    int sum = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) sum += arr[i];
    
    return (sum>0)? 1 : 0;
}
